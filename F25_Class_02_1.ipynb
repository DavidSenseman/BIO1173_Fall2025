        "\n",
        "**Neural networks** were one of the first machine learning models. Their popularity has fallen twice and is now on its third rise. **Deep learning** implies the use of neural networks. The \"deep\" in deep learning refers to a neural network with many hidden layers. Because neural networks have been around for so long, they have quite a bit of baggage. Researchers have created many different training algorithms, activation/transfer functions, and structures. This course is only concerned with the latest, most current state-of-the-art techniques for deep neural networks. We will not spend much time discussing the history of neural networks.\n",
        "\n",
        "Neural networks accept input and produce output. The input to a neural network is called the **_feature vector_**. The size of this vector is always a fixed length. Changing the size of the feature vector usually means recreating the entire neural network. Though the feature vector is called a \"vector,\" this is not always the case. A vector implies a 1D array. Later we will learn about **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**, which can allow the input size to change without retraining the neural network. Historically the input to a neural network was always 1D. However, with modern neural networks, you might see input data, such as:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **1D vector** - Classic input to a neural network, similar to rows in a spreadsheet. Common in predictive modeling.\n",
        "* **2D Matrix** - Grayscale image input to a CNN.\n",
        "* **3D Matrix** - Color image input to a CNN.\n",
        "* **nD Matrix** - Higher-order input to a CNN.\n",
        "\n",
        "Before CNNs, programs either encoded images to an intermediate form or sent the image input to a neural network by merely squashing the image matrix into a long array by placing the image's rows side-by-side. CNNs are different as the matrix passes through the neural network layers.\n",
        "\n",
        "Initially, this vpitdr will focus on 1D input to neural networks. However, later modules will focus more heavily on higher dimension input.\n",
        "\n",
        "The term **dimension** can be confusing in neural networks. In the sense of a 1D input vector, dimension refers to how many elements are in that 1D array. For example, a neural network with ten input neurons has ten dimensions. However, now that we have CNNs, the input has dimensions. The input to the neural network will *usually* have 1, 2, or 3 dimensions. Four or more dimensions are unusual. You might have a 2D input to a neural network with 64x64 pixels. This configuration would result in 4,096 input neurons. This network is either 2D or 4,096D, depending on which dimensions you reference.\n"

Second, hidden neurons only output to other neurons, such as output or other hidden neurons. Hidden neurons help the neural network understand the input and form the output. Programmers often group hidden neurons into fully connected hidden layers. However, these hidden layers do not directly process the incoming data or the eventual output.\n",

[[Cite:hornik1989multilayer]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0893608089900208) Researchers have proven that a single-hidden-layer neural network can function as a universal approximator.

Before researchers introduced deep learning techniques, we did not have an efficient way to train a deep network, which is a neural network with many hidden layers. Although a single-hidden-layer neural network can theoretically learn anything, deep learning facilitates a more complex representation of patterns in the data.  \n",

Along with the linear activation function, you can usually find the softmax function in the output layer of a neural network. Classification neural networks typically employ the softmax function. The neuron with the highest value claims the input as a member of its class. Because it is a preferable method, the softmax activation function forces the neural network's output to represent the probability that the input falls into each of the classes. The neuron's outputs are numeric values without the softmax, with the highest indicating the winning class.\n",

For example, the neural network might tell you that there is an 80% chance that the iris is setosa, a 15% probability that it is virginica, and only a 5% probability of versicolor. Because these are probabilities, they must add up to 100%. There could not be an 80% probability of setosa, a 75% probability of virginica, and a 20% probability of versicolor—this type of result would be nonsensical.\n",

The output neurons do not inherently specify the probability of each of the three species. Therefore, it is desirable to provide probabilities that sum to 100%. The neural network will tell you the likelihood of a flower being each of the three species. To get the probability, use the softmax function in the following equation:\n",

When softmax is the activation function, the output of a single neuron is dependent on the other output neurons.\n",

Backus submitted a proposal to his superiors at IBM to develop a more practical alternative to assembly language for programming their IBM 704 mainframe computer.Backus' historic FORTRAN team consisted of programmers Richard Goldberg, Sheldon F. Best, Harlan Herrick, Peter Sheridan, Roy Nutt, Robert Nelson, Irving Ziller, Harold Stern, Lois Haibt, and David Sayre. Its concepts included easier entry of equations into a computer, an idea developed by J. Halcombe Laning and demonstrated in the Laning and Zierler system of 1952.\n",
        "\n",
        "A draft specification for The IBM Mathematical Formula Translating System was completed by November 1954. The first manual for FORTRAN appeared in October 1956,with the first FORTRAN compiler delivered in April 1957. Fortran produced efficient enough code for assembly language programmers to accept a high-level programming language replacement.\n",
        "\n",
        "John Backus said during a 1979 interview with Think, the IBM employee magazine, \"Much of my work has come from being lazy. I didn't like writing programs, and so, when I was working on the IBM 701, writing programs for computing missile trajectories, I started work on a programming system to make it easier to write programs.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "The language was widely adopted by scientists for writing numerically intensive programs, which encouraged compiler writers to produce compilers that could generate faster and more efficient code. The inclusion of a complex number data type in the language made Fortran especially suited to technical applications such as electrical engineering.\n",
        "\n",
        "By 1960, versions of FORTRAN were available for the IBM 709, 650, 1620, and 7090 computers. Significantly, the increasing popularity of FORTRAN spurred competing computer manufacturers to provide FORTRAN compilers for their machines, so that by 1963 over 40 FORTRAN compilers existed.\n",
        "\n",
        "FORTRAN was provided for the IBM 1401 computer by an innovative 63-phase compiler that ran entirely in its core memory of only 8000 (six-bit) characters. The compiler could be run from tape, or from a 2200-card deck; it used no further tape or disk storage. It kept the program in memory and loaded overlays that gradually transformed it, in place, into executable form, as described by Haines.[21] This article was reprinted, edited, in both editions of Anatomy of a Compiler[22] and in the IBM manual \"Fortran Specifications and Operating Procedures, IBM 1401\".[23] The executable form was not entirely machine language; rather, floating-point arithmetic, sub-scripting, input/output, and function references were interpreted, preceding UCSD Pascal P-code by two decades. GOTRAN, a simplified, interpreted version of FORTRAN I (with only 12 statements not 32) for \"load and go\" operation was available (at least for the early IBM 1620 computer).[24] Modern Fortran, and almost all later versions, are fully compiled, as done for other high-performance languages.\n",
