        "#### What is the Poly A Tail?\n",
        "The **poly A tail** is a long chain of adenine nucleotides (A's) added to the 3' end of a messenger RNA (mRNA) molecule during RNA processing. This process, known as **polyadenylation**, involves the enzyme **poly-A polymerase**. The poly A tail typically consists of 100-250 adenine residues.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Function\n",
        "The primary functions of the poly A tail include:\n",
        "1. **Stability**: It protects the mRNA from enzymatic degradation in the cytoplasm, increasing its stability.\n",
        "2. **Nuclear Export**: It aids in the export of the mRNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, where it can be translated into a protein.\n",
        "3. **Translation Efficiency**: It enhances the translation efficiency of the mRNA by ribosomes.\n",
        "4. **Transcription Termination**: It plays a role in the termination of transcription.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Discovery\n",
        "The discovery of the poly A tail is attributed to several researchers in the 1970s. Notably, **Richard J. Roberts** and **Phillip Sharp** independently discovered introns and the process of RNA splicing, which also contributed to understanding mRNA processing, including polyadenylation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Richard J. Roberts was working at the **Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory** on Long Island, New York, when he made his discovery. Phillip A. Sharp was at the **Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)** in Cambridge, Massachusetts.\n",
        "\n",
        "Their independent discoveries of split genes and RNA splicing in 1977 were groundbreaking and earned them the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1993\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Importance\n",
        "\n",
        "The poly A tail is crucial for gene expression and regulation. It ensures that mRNA molecules are stable enough to be translated into proteins, which is essential for the proper functioning of cells. Additionally, the length of the poly A tail can influence the lifespan of the mRNA and, consequently, the level of protein production.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, the poly A tail is a vital component of mRNA that enhances its stability, aids in its export from the nucleus, and improves translation efficiency, playing a key role in gene expression and regulation.\n",
