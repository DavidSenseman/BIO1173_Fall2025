        "\n",
        "Although dropout works differently than L1 and L2, it accomplishes the same goal—the prevention of overfitting. However, the algorithm does the task by actually _removing_ neurons and connections—at least temporarily. Unlike L1 and L2, no weight penalty is added. Dropout does not directly seek to train small weights.\n",
        "\n",
        "Dropout works by causing hidden neurons of the neural network to be unavailable during part of the training. Dropping part of the neural network causes the remaining portion to be trained to still achieve a good score even without the dropped neurons. This technique decreases co-adaptation between neurons, which results in less overfitting.\n",
        "\n",
        "Most neural network frameworks implement dropout as a separate layer. Dropout layers function like a regular, densely connected neural network layer. The only difference is that the dropout layers will periodically drop some of their neurons during training. You can use dropout layers on regular feedforward neural networks.\n",
        "\n",
        "A _program_ can implement a dropout layer as a dense layer that can eliminate some of its neurons. Contrary to popular belief about the dropout layer, such a program does not permanently remove these discarded neurons. In other words, a dropout layer does **_not_** lose any of its neurons during the training process, and it will still have the same number of neurons after training. In this way, the program only _temporarily masks_ the neurons rather than dropping them.\n",

Only the regular neurons on a dropout layer are candidates.\n",

        "## Why does Dropout work?\n",
        "\n",
        "Why dropout is capable of decreasing overfitting is a common question. The answer is that dropout can reduce the chance of **_codependency_** developing between two neurons. Two neurons that develop codependency will not be able to operate effectively when one is dropped out. As a result, the neural network can no longer rely on the presence of every neuron, and it trains accordingly. This characteristic decreases its ability to memorize the information presented, thereby forcing generalization.\n",
        "\n",
        "Dropout also decreases overfitting by **_forcing a bootstrapping process_** upon the neural network. Bootstrapping is a prevalent ensemble technique. Ensembling is a technique of machine learning that combines multiple models to produce a better result than those achieved by individual models. The ensemble is a term that originates from the musical ensembles in which the final music product that the audience hears is the combination of many instruments.  \n",
        "\n",
        "**_Bootstrapping_** is one of the most simple ensemble techniques. The bootstrapping programmer simply trains several neural networks to perform precisely the same task. However, each neural network will perform differently because of some training techniques and the random numbers used in the neural network weight initialization. The difference in weights causes the performance variance. The output from this ensemble of neural networks becomes the average output of the members taken together. This process decreases overfitting through the consensus of differently trained neural networks.  \n",
        "\n",
        "Dropout works somewhat like bootstrapping. You might think of each neural network that results from a different set of neurons being dropped out as an individual member in an ensemble. As training progresses, the program creates more neural networks in this way. However, dropout does not require the same amount of processing as bootstrapping. The new neural networks created are temporary; they exist only for a training iteration. The final result is also a single neural network rather than an ensemble of neural networks to be averaged together.\n",

It was one of the first successful mass-produced microcomputer products and is widely regarded as one of the most important personal computers of all time due to its role in popularizing home computing and influencing later software development.\n",

        "The Apple II was designed primarily by Steve Wozniak. The system is based around the 8-bit MOS Technology 6502 microprocessor. Jerry Manock designed the foam-molded plastic case, Rod Holt developed the switching power supply, while Steve Jobs was not involved in the design of the computer. It was introduced by Jobs and Wozniak at the 1977 West Coast Computer Faire, and marks Apple's first launch of a computer aimed at a consumer market—branded toward American households rather than businessmen or computer hobbyists.\n",

        "Byte magazine referred to the Apple II, Commodore PET 2001, and TRS-80 as the \"1977 Trinity\". As the Apple II had the defining feature of being able to display color graphics, the Apple logo was redesigned to have a spectrum of colors.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Apple II was the first in a series of computers collectively referred to by the Apple II name. It was followed by the Apple II+, Apple IIe, Apple IIc, Apple IIc Plus, and the 16-bit Apple IIGS—all of which remained compatible. Production of the last available model, the Apple IIe, ceased in November 1993.\n",

        "**History**\n",
        "\n",
        "By 1976, Steve Jobs had convinced product designer Jerry Manock (who had formerly worked at Hewlett Packard designing calculators) to create the \"shell\" for the Apple II—a smooth case inspired by kitchen appliances that concealed the internal mechanics. The earliest Apple II computers were assembled in Silicon Valley and later in Texas; printed circuit boards were manufactured in Ireland and Singapore. The first computers went on sale on June 10, 1977 with an MOS Technology 6502 microprocessor running at 1.023 MHz (2⁄7 of the NTSC color subcarrier), two game paddles (bundled until 1980, when they were found to violate FCC regulations), 4 KiB of RAM, an audio cassette interface for loading programs and storing data, and the Integer BASIC programming language built into ROMs. The video controller displayed 24 lines by 40 columns of monochrome, uppercase-only text on the screen (the original character set matches ASCII characters 20h to 5Fh), with NTSC composite video output suitable for display on a video monitor or on a regular TV set (by way of a separate RF modulator).\n",
        "\n",
        "The original retail price of the computer with 4 KiB of RAM was US \\$1,298 (equivalent to \\$6,530 in 2023) and with the maximum 48 KiB of RAM, it was US \\$2,638 (equivalent to \\$13,260 in 2023) To reflect the computer's color graphics capability, the Apple logo on the casing has rainbow stripes, which remained a part of Apple's corporate logo until early 1998. Perhaps most significantly, the Apple II was a catalyst for personal computers across many industries; it opened the doors to software marketed at consumers.\n",
        "\n",
        "Certain aspects of the system's design were influenced by Atari, Inc.'s arcade video game Breakout (1976), which was designed by Wozniak, who said: \"A lot of features of the Apple II went in because I had designed Breakout for Atari. I had designed it in hardware. I wanted to write it in software now\". This included his design of color graphics circuitry, the addition of game paddle support and sound, and graphics commands in Integer BASIC, with which he wrote Brick Out, a software clone of his own hardware game. Wozniak said in 1984: \"Basically, all the game features were put in just so I could show off the game I was familiar with—Breakout—at the Homebrew Computer Club. It was the most satisfying day of my life I demonstrated Breakout—totally written in BASIC. It seemed like a huge step to me. After designing hardware arcade games, I knew that being able to program them in BASIC was going to change the world.\""
