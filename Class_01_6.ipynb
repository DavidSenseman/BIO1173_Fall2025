Their creation was inspired by biological neural circuitry.[1][a] While some of the computational implementations ANNs relate to earlier discoveries in mathematics, the first implementation of ANNs was by psychologist Frank Rosenblatt, who developed the perceptron. Little research was conducted on ANNs in the 1970s and 1980s, with the AAAI calling this period an \"AI winter\".\n",

The 2010s saw the development of a deep neural network (i.e., one with many layers) called AlexNet. It greatly outperformed other image recognition models, and is thought to have launched the ongoing AI spring, and further increasing interest in deep learning. The transformer architecture was first described in 2017 as a method to teach ANNs grammatical dependencies in language, and is the predominant architecture used by large language models such as GPT-4. Diffusion models were first described in 2015, and became the basis of image generation models such as DALL-E in the 2020s\n",

        "A logical calculus of the ideas immanent in nervous activity (Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts, 1943) studied several abstract models for neural networks using symbolic logic of Rudolf Carnap and Principia Mathematica. The paper argued that several abstract models of neural networks (some learning, some not learning) have the same computational power as Turing machines. This model paved the way for research to split into two approaches. One approach focused on biological processes while the other focused on the application of neural networks to artificial intelligence. This work led to work on nerve networks and their link to finite automata.\n",

This evolved into models for long-term potentiation. Researchers started applying these ideas to computational models in 1948 with Turing's B-type machines. B. Farley and Wesley A. Clark (1954) first used computational machines, then called \"calculators\", to simulate a Hebbian network. Other neural network computational machines were created by Rochester, Holland, Habit and Duda (1956).\n",

In 1959, a biological model proposed by Nobel laureates Hubel and Wiesel was based on their discovery of two types of cells in the primary visual cortex: simple cells and complex cells. He later published a 1962 book also introduced variants and computer experiments, including a version with four-layer perceptrons where the last two layers have learned weights (and thus a proper multilayer perceptron).[16]: section 16 Some consider that the 1962 book developed and explored all of the basic ingredients of the deep learning systems of today.\n",

Kelley had a continuous precursor of backpropagation in 1960 in the context of control theory. The modern form of backpropagation was developed multiple times in early 1970s. The earliest published instance was Seppo Linnainmaa's master thesis (1970). Paul Werbos developed it independently in 1971, but had difficulty publishing it until 1982. In 1986, David E.

Shun'ichi Amari in 1972 proposed to modify the weights of an Ising model by Hebbian learning rule as a model of associative memory, adding in the component of learning.[36] This was popularized as the Hopfield network (1982).\n",

Hochreiter proposed recurrent residual connections to solve the vanishing gradient problem. This led to the long short-term memory (LSTM), published in 1995. LSTM can learn \"very deep learning\" tasks with long credit assignment paths that require memories of events that happened thousands of discrete time steps before.

The neocognitron introduced the two basic types of layers in CNNs: convolutional layers, and downsampling layers. A convolutional layer contains units whose receptive fields cover a patch of the previous layer. The weight vector (the set of adaptive parameters) of such a unit is often called a filter. Units can share filters. Downsampling layers contain units whose receptive fields cover patches of previous convolutional layers. Such a unit typically computes the average of the activations of the units in its patch. This downsampling helps to correctly classify objects in visual scenes even when the objects are shifted.\n",

Thus, while also using a pyramidal structure as in the neocognitron, it performed a global optimization of the weights instead of a local one.\n",

Learning was fully automatic, performed better than manual coefficient design, and was suited to a broader range of image recognition problems and image types. Subsequently, Wei Zhang, et al. modified their model by removing the last fully connected layer and applied it for medical image object segmentation in 1991 and breast cancer detection in mammograms in 1994.\n",
